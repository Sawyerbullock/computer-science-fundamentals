2. Provide another real-world example that you can model using a data structure.
A: A batting order for a baseball team.

3. How would your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
A: We could store the data in an array. There would be 9 positions, for each spot in the batting order.
   Then write code that would allow you to substitute players in and out of the lineup,
   and also to shift players around inside of the array to change the order. There could also be some
   code to check to see what position in the lineup a player is currently in.
