1. What are some pros and cons of using linked lists instead of arrays?
A: Pros us using linked lists include not having to use any empty place-holders,
   since nodes are dynamically instantiated, and they are memory independent, which
   means, they can be stored in any available memory location, unlike arrays, which
   must use contiguous locations in memory. However, since each node of a linked list
   can exist anywhere in memory, it's not quite as efficient to access a specific
   element within a linked list. You must go through the elements in order to find
   what you're looking for, unlike arrays, which are indexed and can be accessed
   immediately.

2. Come up with a real world example of a linked list.
A: The thing that came to me was a playlist. It would use up a lot of memory and
   performance to have to shift the computers entire memory each time a song is
   added to a playlist.
