1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?
A: Looking for somebody's name on a non-alphabetized guest list.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?
A: Searching for a word in a dictionary.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
   iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
A: 7 iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many
   iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
A: 3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would
   you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your
   reasoning.
A: I would use a linear search. Since the data is unsorted, a binary search
   would not work.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
   choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.
A: I would use binary search. With sorted data, we could compare a middle
   data point to our target, and then split it in half accordingly.
