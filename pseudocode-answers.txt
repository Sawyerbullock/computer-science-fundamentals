/* Short Answer */

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode.
A: Pseudocode is an informal language that is used to develop algorithms
and express what could should do without using any specific syntax.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
A: Nothing. Pseudocode is not meant to be run on a computer.

/* Programming Assignment */

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and outputs the greater number.
A: INPUT first numbers
   INPUT second numbers
   IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
     PRINT first numbers
   ELSE IF the first number is smaller than the second number THEN
     PRINT second number
   ELSE
     PRINT "Numbers are the same."
   END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.
A:  SET number to 1
    WHILE number is less than or equal to 100
      PRINT number
      ADD 1 to number
    END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.
A:  GET phonebook
    GET searchItem
    FOR each item in phonebook
      IF item is equal to searchItem
        PRINT item
      Else go to next item in phonebook
      END IF
      PRINT "not found"

4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.
A: I created the function in repl.it:

const phoneBook = [
  {
    name: "John Doe", number: "123-456-7890"
  },
  {
    name: "Jane Doe", number: "098-765-4321"
  },
  {
    name: "Joe Shmoe", number: "321-456-0987"
  },
]

function searchName(name){
  for (i = 0; i < phoneBook.length; i++){
    if(phoneBook[i].name == name){
      return phoneBook[i];
    }
  }
  return "not found";
}

console.log(searchName("John Doe"))
console.log(searchName("Mike Smith"))
