1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.
A: Clean code is written in a way that is easy to understand and make changes to in the future.
   It is important, because usually you will be working as a part of a team of developers, and you
   want to ensure that if anybody looks at your code to review or edit it, they can easily see what
   the code is supposed to do, and why it's written the way that it is.

2. Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code was not created to an acceptable standard.
A: Although it may be slightly similar to the Toyota scenario, the first thought that came to my mind was Tesla's self driving cars.
   This is definitely an area where there is no margin for error in the code. If there was a bug in the system that made the car brake
   and come to a stop when there was an object in it's path, there would surely be some fatalities.

3. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.
A: No. The function name doesn't tell you at all the purpose fo the function, and there are too many comments.

  FUNCTION convertTemperature(degrees, scale)
    IF scale = "Fahrenheit" Then
      SET convertedTemperature to (degrees - 32) * (5/9)
      PRINT convertedTemperature
    ELSE IF scale = "Celsius" Then
      SET convertedTemperature to (degrees * 1.8000 + 32.00)
      PRINT convertedTemperature
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

4. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or why not. If not, refactor the code.
A: No. You shouldn't abbreviate function names, and the `PRINT percentage` should be inside the IF statement.

  FUNCTION calculatePercent(sum, total)
    IF NOT(total = 0) Then
      SET percentage to (sum / total) * 100
      PRINT percentage
    ELSE
      PRINT "Sorry, cannot divide by 0"
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

5.a.
  FUNCTION checkOutCustomer(subTotal, discountRate)
    SET totalDue to subTotal * discountRate + (subTotal * tax)
    PRINT "Your total due is: " + totalDue
    CALL getPayment with totalDue
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION getPayment(totalDue, paymentType)
    IF paymentType = 'CASH' THEN
      SET amount to cash received
      PRINT "Change due: " + amount - totalDue
    ELSE IF paymentType = 'CREDIT CARD' THEN
      PRINT "Your credit card has been charged: " + totalDue
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

b.
  FUNCTION isGuestCleared(guest)
    IF guest.accountActive AND guest.outstandingFees = 0 AND NOT(guest.hasOverdueBooks) THEN
      RETURN true
    ELSE
      RETURN false
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION checkoutBook(book, guest)
    IF isGuestCleared(guest) Then
      APPEND book to guest.books
      SET book.status to "Checked Out"
      PRINT "Your books have been issued."
    ELSE
      PRINT "Unable to check out book."
    END IF
  END FUNCTION

c.
  CLASS BankAccount

    FUNCTION displayBalance(accountHolder)
      PRINT accountHolder.balance
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION deposit(amount, accountHolder)
      ADD amount to accountHolder.balance
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION withdraw(amount, accountHolder)
      IF accountHolder.balance > amount THEN
        SUBTRACT amount from accountHolder.balance
      END IF
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION offerCreditCard(accountHolder)
      IF NOT(accountHolder.hasCreditCard) THEN
        call creditCardOffer
      END IF
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION checkCustomerStatus(accountHolder)
      IF NOT(accountHolder.hasCheckingAccount) THEN
        CALL offerCheckingAccout
      END IF
    END FUNCTION
